## hybrid-synthesis: a synthesis flow for the digital mode and the analog mode (multiply-and-accumulate)
* function: synthesize an application in the skeleton representation onto the target architecture with hybrid ReRAM crossbars
* compiling: ``mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build .``
* usage: write the application using nested skeletons in main.cpp to get its latency and bounding box
* todo: integrate the digital synthesis flow and support the analog mode
